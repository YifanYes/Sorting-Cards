# Sorting cards

Sorting is considered to be an important concept in many programming languages as it helps us locate elements in a faster and easier manner.

- Create a function that generates a list of random cards with suits.
- Let the user specify how much random cards the website should generate using a text input.
- Add a "draw" button that when clicked it renders those cards on the website in a beautiful way.
- Add buttons that sorts the cards using the bubble sort and selection sort algorithms.
- Save all the changes that you hard to do while sorting the list of cards in a new array.
- Display the entire log of changes one on top of each other.
